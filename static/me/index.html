                <h3>Why I Want to Pursue a PhD</h3>
                <h4>Personal Motivation and Vision</h4>
                <p><strong>Story:</strong> My grandmother’s battle with breast cancer, complicated by rare metastasis to the esophagus, left a profound impression on me. Witnessing the advancements in cancer treatments that have significantly reduced mortality and morbidity inspired my commitment to this field. During my house job and emergency room experience, I encountered numerous cases of hepatitis B and C, and a rising prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These experiences deepened my understanding of the urgent need for translational research to address both prevention and treatment gaps.</p>
                <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> These personal and professional experiences drive my passion for advancing cancer care and ensuring equitable access to effective treatments.</p>
                <p><strong>Vision:</strong> By pursuing a PhD, I aim to develop innovative solutions and foster collaborations that bridge research and equitable clinical care.</p>
